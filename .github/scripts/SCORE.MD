# Cache Notes
- All .robot files are re-parsed each run.
- Each task is identified by title alone.
- If the title is found in the persistent cache, we reuse that score. Otherwise, we call the LLM.
- The entire result set (existing + newly added tasks) is saved back to JSON.
- Deleted tasks or codebundles typically vanish if you only store the newly found tasks in the final JSON. Or they stick around if youâ€™re merging data and not removing old entries.
