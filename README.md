# RunWhen Public Codecollection
This repository is a codecollection that is to be used within the RunWhen platform. It contains codebundles that can be used in SLIs, and TaskSets. 

Please see the **[contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md)** and **[code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)** for details on adding your contributions to this project. 

Documentation for each codebundle is maintained in the README.md alongside the robot code and is published at [https://docs.runwhen.com/public/v/codebundles/](https://docs.runwhen.com/public/v/codebundles/). Please see the [readme howto](README_HOWTO.md) for details on crafting a codebundle readme that can be indexed.
