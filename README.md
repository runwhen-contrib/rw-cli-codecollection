# RunWhen Public Codecollection
This repository is a codecollection that is to be used within the RunWhen platform. It contains codebundles that can be used in SLIs, and TaskSets. 

Please see the **[contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md)** and **[code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)** for details on adding your contributions to this project. 

Documentation for each codebundle is maintained in the README.md alongside the robot code and is published at [https://docs.runwhen.com/public/v/codebundles/](https://docs.runwhen.com/public/v/codebundles/). Please see the [readme howto](README_HOWTO.md) for details on crafting a codebundle readme that can be indexed.

## Getting Started
Head on over to our centralized documentation [here](https://docs.runwhen.com/public/runwhen-authors/getting-started-with-codecollection-development) for detailed information on getting started.

File Structure overview of devcontainer:
```
-/app/
    |- auth/ # store secrets here, it should already be properly gitignored for you
    |- codecollection/
    |   |- codebundles/ # stores codebundles that can be run during development
    |   |- libraries/ # stores python keyword libraries used by codebundles
    |- dev_facade/ # provides interfaces equivalent to those used on the platform, but just dry runs the keywords to assist with development
    ...
```

The included script `ro` wraps the `robot` RobotFramework binary, and includes some extra functionality to write files to a consistent location for viewing in a HTTP server at http://localhost:3000/ that is always running as part of the devcontainer.

### Quickstart

Navigate to the codebundle directory
`cd codecollection/codebundles/curl-http-ok/`

Run the codebundle
`ro runbook.robot`
