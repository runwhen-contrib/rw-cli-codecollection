# Azure Application Gateway Health

- `AZ_USERNAME`: Service principal's client ID
- `AZ_SECRET_VALUE`: The credential secret value from the app registration
- `AZ_TENANT`: The Azure tenancy ID
- `AZ_SUBSCRIPTION`: The Azure subscription ID
- `AZ_RESOURCE_GROUP`: The Azure resource group that these resources reside in
- `APPGATEWAY`: The name of the application gateway in the resource group to target with checks

## Notes

This codebundle assumes the service principal authentication flow.
