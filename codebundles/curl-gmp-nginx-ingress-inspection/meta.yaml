  explanation: "\n\nThis command is used to gather information from the Google Kubernetes\
    \ Engine (GKE) cluster about errors in nginx that are encountered on ingress controller\
    \ requests. The command requires a few variables such as the GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS\
    \ which uses authorization details to access resources on GCP. \n\nThe TIME_SLICE\
    \ value is set to gather metrics over a specific time range. ERROR_CODES will\
    \ tell the command what type of errors to look for, such as 404 or 500 errors.\
    \  Finally, GCP_PROJECT_ID is the unique identifier for your project in GCP.\n\
    \nOnce this command runs, it will use the curl command to query the GKE monitoring\
    \ API and then use jq to read the response and output relevant information about\
    \ any detected issues in the form of host, ingress, namespace, and service."

  explanation: '


    This command authenticates your Google Cloud Platform account and then sends a
    query to the Prometheus API. The query measures the number of requests for nginx
    ingress controller that result in an error, over given time slices. This information
    is used by Kubernetes to manage and monitor applications running on its clusters.
    Knowing how many requests are resulting in errors helps identify potential problems.'
