commands:
- command: 'curl -o /dev/null -w ''{"http_code": %{http_code}, "time_total": %{time_total}}''
    -s ${URL}'
  explanation: '


    This command is using the cURL tool to access a given URL. It reports the HTTP
    code and the total time taken in milliseconds with a response in a JSON format
    and writing it to /dev/null (the null device which discards all data sent to it).
    This is useful for checking if a web page or application is available, testing
    the response times and confirming that the desired status codes are being returned.
    This can be used in Kubernetes to check the availability of APIs, services, pod
    deployments and more.'
