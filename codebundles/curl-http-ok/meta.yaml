  explanation: This command uses the curl tool to send a request to a specific URL
    and outputs the HTTP response code and the total time of the request in JSON format.
    The output is directed to /dev/null, meaning it won't be displayed on the terminal.
  multi_line_details: "# This is a multi-line command in bash to make a cURL request\
    \ and output only the HTTP code and total time taken\n# The -o flag is used to\
    \ redirect the output to /dev/null, so it doesn't print anything to the console\n\
    # The -w flag is used to format the output as a JSON object containing the http_code\
    \ and time_total\n# The -s flag is used to silence any progress or error message\

    : %{time_total}}' \\\n  -s ${URL}"
