# AWS Jenkins Health

This CodeBundle monitors and evaluates the health of Jenkins using the Jenkins REST API

## SLI
The SLI produces a score of 0 (bad), 1(good), or a value in between. This score is generated by capturing the following: 
- Check if Jenkins instance is reachable and responding (endpoint)
- Check For Failed Build Logs in Jenkins
- Check For Long Running Builds in Jenkins
- Check For Long Queued Builds in Jenkins
- Check Jenkins Executor Utilization

## TaskSet
Similar to the SLI, but produces a report on the specific jenkns apis and raises issues for each Jenkins check that requires attention. 

## Required Configuration

```
    export JENKINS_URL=""
	export JENKINS_USERNAME=""
	export JENKINS_TOKEN=""
```

## Testing 
See the `.test` directory for infrastructure test code.
