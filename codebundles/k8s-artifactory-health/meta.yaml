  explanation: '


    This command uses the kubectl command line utility to execute a curl command on
    a StatefulSet with the given name, in the given context and namespace. The curl
    command makes a request to the localhost at port 8091 of the StatefulSet and obtains
    the liveness information from the Artifactory API v1. This command is used to
    regularly check whether the StatefulSet is running and if so, how many instances
    are running.'

  explanation: '


    This command uses the kubectl command line tool to check the readiness of a service
    called "statefulset" in a particular context and namespace. It does this by sending
    an http request to a specific port (8091) on the localhost. This allows you to
    determine whether the service is ready to accept requests or not. This command
    can also be used to periodically check if the service is still running properly.'
