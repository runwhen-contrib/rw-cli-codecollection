  explanation: '


    Kubectl exec is a command that allows you to run a command inside a running container
    in kubernetes. In the above command, it will execute a curl command inside a container
    part of a statefulset with name ${STATEFULSET_NAME} which exists within a kubernetes
    cluster with context ${CONTEXT} and namespace ${NAMESPACE}. The curl command will
    perform a request on localhost (inside the container) on port 8091 and send a
    liveness check request with a max timeout of 10 seconds.'

  explanation: '


    This command checks the readiness status of a StatefulSet in Kubernetes. The "kubectl
    exec" command is used to execute commands on a Kubernetes Pod. In this case, you
    are executing the ''curl'' command to check the status of the Artifactory service
    running in the StatefulSet, named ${STATEFULSET_NAME}, which is running in the
    ${CONTEXT} Kubernetes context and in the ${NAMESPACE} namespace. This command
    runs with a timeout of 10 seconds, after which it will error out.'
