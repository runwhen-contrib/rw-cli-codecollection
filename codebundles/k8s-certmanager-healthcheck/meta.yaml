  explanation: This command retrieves certificate information from the cert-manager
    within a specific context and namespace, and uses JSON parsing to select only
    the certificates that are ready for renewal or have expired. It then prints out
    details such as namespace, URL, renewal time, and expiration time for each selected
    certificate.
