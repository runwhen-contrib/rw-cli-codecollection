# Author: @stewartshea
# Description: This script takes in event message strings captured from a 
# Kubernetes DaemonSet system and provides more concrete issue details in json format.
# This adapts the StatefulSet version for DaemonSet-specific concerns like node scheduling,
# tolerations, and daemon processes running on specific nodes.
