commands:
- command: kubectl logs deployment/${DEPLOYMENT_NAME} --limit-bytes=256000 --since=3h
    --context=${CONTEXT} -n ${NAMESPACE} | grep -Ei "${LOGS_ERROR_PATTERN}" | grep
    -Eiv "${LOGS_EXCLUDE_PATTERN}" | sort | uniq -c | awk '{print "Occurences:",$0}'
  explanation: '


    This command will display the logs for a particular Kubernetes deployment and
    filter out specific error messages. The limit bytes parameter will set a limit
    on the size of the log output in bytes (in this case 256000). The since parameter
    specifies how far back the log will search, in this case three hours. The context
    parameter specifies the environment from which the commands are being executed
    (this is usually the cluster name). The namespace parameter gives the namespace
    associated with the deployment to be targeted by the command. The grep commands
    are used to filter out any lines containing words matches the ''logs_error_pattern''."The
    log_exclude_pattern" can be used to exclude lines containing words that match
    the given pattern. Finally, sort will sort the output and uniq -c will give a
    frequency count for unique values that have been sorted previously. The awk command
    is then used to format the output to "Occurences: [number] [value]"'

- command: kubectl get events --context ${CONTEXT} -n ${NAMESPACE} --field-selector
    type=Warning | grep -i "${DEPLOYMENT_NAME}" || true
  explanation: '


    This command uses kubectl to get Events for a specific context and namespace.
    It then filters those events by type, looking specifically for Warning level events,
    and also filters those results again by the deployment name you provide. The "||
    true" at the end of the command is used to ensure that it always returns as having
    succeeded (even if there are no results from the initial query).'

- command: kubectl get deployment/${DEPLOYMENT_NAME} --context ${CONTEXT} -n ${NAMESPACE}
    -o yaml
  explanation: '


    This kubectl command retrieves the Kubernetes deployment configuration for the
    specified ${DEPLOYMENT_NAME} in the given ${CONTEXT} and ${NAMESPACE}, and outputs
    it in YAML format. This is useful if you need to examine or modify a deployment
    configuration, or if you just want to view the settings that are currently being
    used by a given deployment.'

- command: kubectl get deployment/${DEPLOYMENT_NAME} --context ${CONTEXT} -n ${NAMESPACE}
    -o json
  explanation: '


    This command is used when retrieving the configuration settings of a Kubernetes
    deployment. The "${DEPLOYMENT_NAME}" argument specifies the name of the deployment
    to be retrieved, the "--context" argument allows you to specify the Kubernetes
    context in which the deployment resides, and the "-n ${NAMESPACE}" argument allows
    you to specify the namespace that contains the desired deployment. Finally, the
    "-o json" argument indicates that you''d like the output information returned
    in a JSON format.'

  explanation: "\n\nThis command is used to identify events that occurred in a Kubernetes\
    \ cluster. The command will filter out all warning events and only return events\
    \ with a frequency higher than the \"ANOMALY_THRESHOLD\". The command takes two\
    \ arguments: CONTEXT and NAMESPACE. \n\nThe CONTEXT argument specifies which context\
    \ to run the command in and the NAMESPACE argument specifies which namespace the\
    \ events should be retrieved from. The output of the command provides information\
    \ about each event such as the number of events per minute, the count, number\
    \ of minutes, involved object (like namespace or resource kind) name, reason and\
    \ message."
