commands:
- command: kubectl get events --field-selector type=Warning --context ${CONTEXT} -n
    ${NAMESPACE} -o json
  explanation: '


    This command allows you to retrieve a list of Kubernetes events related to any
    potential warnings that may have been generated. It specifically filters the events
    for type "Warning" and can be used with the context and namespace parameters provided
    in the command to obtain more specific results. The output format is json which
    provides an easy to read and parse output.'

- command: kubectl get pods --context=${CONTEXT} -n ${NAMESPACE} --sort-by='status.containerStatuses[0].restartCount'
    --field-selector=status.phase=Failed --no-headers | grep -v Completed || true
  explanation: '


    Kubectl get pods is a command-line tool used to retrieve all of the pods in a
    Kubernetes cluster. The --context flag specifies which context you want to query
    from. The -n flag specifies the namespace for the desired pods. By passing in
    the --sort-by option, we can sort the pods by the restart count of the first container
    in the pod. Finally, with the --field-selector, we can restrict our query to only
    pods that are in the Failed phase. The --no-headers parameter eliminates all of
    the column headers from the output. Lastly, the grep and true statement allow
    us to filter out any successfully completed pods from the output.'

- command: kubectl get all --context ${CONTEXT} -n ${NAMESPACE} -o json
  explanation: '


    Kubectl get all --context ${CONTEXT} -n ${NAMESPACE} -o json is a command that
    allows you to access Kubernetes resources in a specific context and namespace
    with an output of json. The ${CONTEXT} and ${NAMESPACE} arguments allow you to
    be more specific when searching for resources. This command can be useful if you
    want to take a deeper look into the Kubernetes resources you have available in
    a particular context and namespace.'

- command: kubectl api-resources --verbs=list --namespaced -o name --context=${CONTEXT}
    | xargs -n 1 kubectl get --show-kind --ignore-not-found -n ${NAMESPACE} --context=${CONTEXT}
  explanation: "\n\nThis command retrieves the list of resources available in the\
    \ Kubernetes cluster that you are currently connected to. This is useful for knowing\
    \ what type of objects are available with the Kubernetes API. First, it searches\
    \ for all resources available on the cluster and only returns a list of the names.\
    \ It then applies flags to determine which verb (in this case \"list\") should\
    \ be used, allowing you to access more information about each resource. The \u2013\
    namespaced flag limits results to those resources that require a namespace to\
    \ be specified, while the \u2013context flag specifies the connection context\
    \ of the current cluster. Finally, the xargs command is used to get additional\
    \ details about the resources, such as their type (-show-kind) and if they have\
    \ been found (-ignore-not-found). It will also ensure any retrieved resources\
    \ belong to the specified namespace (-n ${NAMESPACE})."

  explanation: '


    This command is used to get logs from Kubernetes services in a given context and
    namespace. It retrieves all service names using the kubectl get svc command and
    stores them in an array named "services". Then it loops through each service,
    retrieving the logs with kubectl logs and storing them in the "logs" variable.
    Lastly, the output is filtered based on patterns provided by the user and printed
    out.'
