    This command is used to get the list of Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) from
    a Kubernetes cluster. Specifically, it retrieves the names of CRDs in the specified
    ''namespace'' and ''context''. Kubernetes allows users to define custom resource
    objects, or CRDs, that map to real-world objects within their organization or
    environment. By retrieving a list of CRDs, an engineer can inspect what resources
    are available in the cluster.'

    -o=name --field-selector=status.phase=Running
  explanation: '


    This command is used to list running pods in a Kubernetes cluster. Kubectl is
    the command line tool for controlling Kubernetes clusters, and ''get'' retrieves
    information about the objects in the cluster. ''pods'' means we are retrieving
    information about containers in the cluster. The ''-l'' flag allows you to select
    resources based on labels (i.e., RESOURCE_LABELS). The `-n` flag allows you to
    specify the namespace in which to look for resources. The ''--context'' flag allows
    you to specify the context in which the command is run. This can be used to switch
    between multiple clusters. The -o=name flag provides output as Pod names only.
    Finally, the `--field-selector=status.phase=Running` limits the results to only
    those pods that are in the Running status phase.'

- command: patronictl list
  explanation: '


    This command lists all of the Patroni instances that are currently running on
    your Kubernetes cluster. It provides information such as the name, state, high-availability
    role, age, and so on. This is a useful tool to get an overview of the Patroni
    clusters that are in use and see what nodes are available for operation. This
    command helps make sure that your databases are operating optimally, no databases
    are missing, and that the infrastructure is set up correctly with the necessary
    settings.'
