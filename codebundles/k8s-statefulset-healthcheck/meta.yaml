- command: kubectl logs --tail=100 statefulset/${STATEFULSET_NAME} --context ${CONTEXT}
    -n ${NAMESPACE}
  explanation: " \n\nThis command allows you to view the last 100 lines of logs from\
    \ a statefulset named ${STATEFULSET_NAME} in the selected Kubernetes context and\
    \ namespace. By using the \"kubectl logs\" command, you can access useful information\
    \ about the performance, health and other operational aspects of the running application\
    \ contained in the statefulset. The --tail=100 option limits the amount of output\
    \ to the last 100 records, making it easier for troubleshooting. Finally, the\
    \ --context and -n options ensure that the command is executed in the correct\
    \ context (cluster) and namespace."

- command: kubectl get events --field-selector type=Warning --context ${CONTEXT} -n
    ${NAMESPACE} | grep -i "${STATEFULSET_NAME}" || true
  explanation: '


    This command allows you to view the events related to a StatefulSet in a specific
    namespace and context. It does this by using the kubectl get command to retrieve
    events with a field selector of type=Warning, which specifies that only events
    with Warning level severity will be returned. Additionally, the command includes
    the ${CONTEXT} and ${NAMESPACE} parameters, which let you specify which cluster
    context and namespace the command should search for the StatefulSet''s events.
    Finally, the command also uses grep -i to search for the StatefulSet specified
    by the variable ${STATEFULSET_NAME}. The || true at the end ensures that the command
    will always return true, even if no matching events are found.'

- command: kubectl get statefulset ${LABELS} --context=${CONTEXT} -n ${NAMESPACE}
    -o yaml
  explanation: '


    This command fetches the definition of a StatefulSet object from a Kubernetes
    cluster context. The ${LABELS} argument allows you to filter StatefulSets by their
    labels. ${CONTEXT} determines which kubernetes cluster you are querying from.
    ${NAMESPACE} is the namespace you want to query in. Finally, -o yaml requests
    the output be returned as YAML instead of table format.'

    Desired Replicas: " + (.status.replicas|tostring) + "

  explanation: '


    Kubectl get statefulset is a command used to retrieve information from your Kubernetes
    cluster about statefulsets. It takes two arguments: -n (NAMEPSACE) and --context
    (CONTEXT). The -n argument specifies the namespace in which to search for the
    statefulset, while the --context argument defines the specific cluster on which
    to execute the command. The command will print out the retrieved statefulset information
    as a JSON object. The second part of this command, jq, helps to filter through
    the returned data for relevant information and prints it out in a neatly formatted
    manner with its break down of desired replicas versus available replicas to give
    you an overview of the health of the statefulset.'
