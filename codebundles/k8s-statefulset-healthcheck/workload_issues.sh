# Author: @stewartshea
# Description: This script takes in event message strings captured from a 
# Kubernetes StatefulSet system and provides more concrete issue details in json format.
# This adapts the deployment version for StatefulSet-specific concerns like persistent storage
# and ordered pod deployment.
