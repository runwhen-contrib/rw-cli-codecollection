commands:
- command: kubectl logs --tail=100 daemonset.apps/vault-csi-provider --context ${CONTEXT}
    -n ${NAMESPACE}
  explanation: '


    This command will print out the 100 most recent log messages from the "vault-csi-provider"
    daemon set for the given Kubernetes context and namespace. The daemonset is a
    type of controller which is responsible for running one instance of containerized
    software across all nodes in the cluster. The "kubectl logs" command allows an
    administrator or developer to monitor the output of their applications running
    in the cluster, which is essential for troubleshooting any issues that may arise.'

- command: kubectl get events --field-selector type=Warning --context ${CONTEXT} -n
    ${NAMESPACE} | grep -i "vault-csi-provider" || true
  explanation: "\n\nThis command uses the kubectl utility to get Kubernetes events,\
    \ filtering for only those events whose type is \u201CWarning\u201D, within the\
    \ context specified by ${CONTEXT} and limited to the supplied namespace (${NAMESPACE}).\
    \ Additionally, it also filters for any events related to \u201Cvault-csi-provider\u201D\
    . The \u201C|| true\u201D at the end allows the command to always return a successful\
    \ exit code even if no matching events are found."

- command: kubectl describe daemonset.apps/vault-csi-provider --context ${CONTEXT}
    -n ${NAMESPACE}
  explanation: '


    This command will describe the DaemonSet "vault-csi-provider" in context "${CONTEXT}"
    and namespace "${NAMESPACE}". It does this by using the kubectl describe command,
    which retrieves information about the specified Kubernetes resource. In this case,
    the information are related to a DaemonSet with the identifier "vault-csi-provider",
    allowing you to view all the details about that specific resource.'

- command: kubectl logs --tail=100 statefulset.apps/vault --context ${CONTEXT} -n
    ${NAMESPACE}
  explanation: '


    This command will display the most recent 100 log lines from a particular StatefulSet
    called "vault" in Kubernetes. The context and namespace provided are used to set
    up the necessary authentication and security parameters for the command. After
    executing the command, you can view the logs generated by the StatefulSet which
    allow you to better understand what is happening with the application.'
  name: fetch_vault_logs
- command: kubectl get events --field-selector type=Warning --context ${CONTEXT} -n
    ${NAMESPACE} | grep -i "vault" || true
  explanation: '


    This command will get all events of type "Warning" in your Kubernetes context
    (${CONTEXT}) and namespace (${NAMESPACE}) that contain the word "vault". The output
    will be printed to the console. The pipe (||) is used as a fail-safe in case no
    events containing "vault" are found, in which case the command will return true
    instead of erroring out.'
  name: get_related_vault_events
- command: kubectl get statefulset.apps/vault --context=${CONTEXT} -n ${NAMESPACE}
    -o yaml
  explanation: '


    This command allows you to view the details of a stateful set named ''vault''
    in a Kubernetes cluster. It will give you information such as the total number
    of replicas, the template used to create each replica, etc. This command takes
    three arguments: context, namespace, and output format. The context argument is
    used to define the cloud or Kuberenetes cluster from which the data is obtained,
    while the namespace argument defines the Kubernetes namespace that contains the
    desired object. Finally, the output format (-o) flag specifies the desired output
    format, which in this case is yaml.'
  name: fetch_vault_statefulset_manifest_details
- command: kubectl get daemonset.apps/vault-csi-provider --context=${CONTEXT} -n ${NAMESPACE}
    -o yaml
  explanation: '


    The command "kubectl get daemonset.apps/vault-csi-provider --context=${CONTEXT}
    -n ${NAMESPACE} -o yaml" is used to fetch and display a DaemonSet (vault-csi-provider)
    in the Kubernetes cluster represented by the specified context (${CONTEXT}) and
    namespace (${NAMESPACE}). The "-o yaml" flag returns the object in a YAML format
    which is an industry standard configuration file format used by Kubernetes. The
    returned YAML document contains the configuration of the DaemonSet, including
    its metadata, spec, and desired state.'

- command: curl ${VAULT_URL}
  explanation: '


    The command ''curl ${VAULT_URL}'' is used to access a secure repository in Kubernetes
    known as a vault. The URL provided references the specific vault, and using this
    command retrieves all of the data stored in it. This data can then be used by
    various Kubernetes resources like containers and deployments to access sensitive
    information like passwords and keys without having to store them in plaintext.
    This provides a secure and reliable way to handle confidential information while
    taking advantage of Kubernetes'' powerful features.'
  name: verify_vault_availability
- command: kubectl get statefulset.apps/vault --context=${CONTEXT} -n ${NAMESPACE}
    -o json
  explanation: '


    This command will allow you to get information about a StatefulSet called "vault"
    from a Kubernetes cluster. It will retrieve this data for the context and namespace
    indicated with the variables CONTEXT and NAMESPACE respectively. The output of
    the command is in JSON format, making it easier to read.'
