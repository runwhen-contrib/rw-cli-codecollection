# Mapping of Kubernetes troubleshooting suggestions for next steps
# structure adheres to following rules to keep things DRY:
# 1. If you foresee a set of titles/objects used under many keys (errors), create anchors and reference them
# 2. if the set of tasks for the key (error) is unlikely to be used elsewhere, simply hardcode them
# If an array index contains a ':' it will be formatted seperately as a object hint
# EXAMPLE:
#
# ErrorMessageToSearchOn:
#   - A suggested task title to run A
#   - A suggested task title to run B
#   - A suggested task title to run C
#   - ObjectTypeAssociatedWithError:$name_variable_of_object_to_run_tasks_against
# the $name_variable_of_object_to_run_tasks_against can be dynamically injected
# with the object name to investigate using RW.NextSteps.Format
# aliases are typically error messages you would associate with the troubleshooting steps
